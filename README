Danbo
=====

See AUTHORS and COPYRIGHT for the list of contributors.

Build from source
=================

The easiest way to  build and run Danbo is to get Eclipse (www.eclipse.org) and
ADT (http://developer.android.com/sdk/eclipse-adt.html). Create a new Android
Project, choose "From existing source" and select the folder where you found
this README. You can create an Android package (.apk) by right clicking on the
project, selecting "Android Tools" and then "Export Unsigned Application 
Package".
